# directConnect - Network

⦃param⦄ network is a permissioned-public blockchain. Public means anyone can use the ⦃param⦄ ledger to make transactions. Permissioned only relates to who can actually operate the network and run the validator nodes. Unlike bitcoin that allows anyone to run a node and become a ‘miner,’ ⦃param⦄ only allows trusted entities called ----, to run the network of validator nodes that achieve consensus of the transactions on the ledger.

Companies and entities who apply to be Stewards must be voted on, and agree to abide by the [Sovrin Trust Framework](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/)

Sovrin is open source and free for any developer to use and build on. The Sovrin Foundation and Trust Framework governance structure ensures that no single individual, organization, jurisdiction, industry sector, or other special interest has influence or power over the Network.
